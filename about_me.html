						<h2>My Data Analysis Roadmap</h2>
						<p>How I went from studying Nutrition and Health to becoming a data analyst</p>
					</header>
					<p>
						Hi there! I am a young data analyst with a passion for health and sustainability. I am most
						experienced with SQL, python, Power BI, and more! Take a look at my recent data analysis
						projects to see an overview of my skills.
					</p>
					<p> Besides SQL, python and Power BI, i have some experience using Tableau and more advanced
						features
						of Microsoft Excel, including pivot tables. In my spare time I have been studying JavaScript,
						HTML and CSS, trying to become more skilled at web development.
					</p>

							<h3>Where I started</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							I started my jouney as a data analyst during my bachelor's and master's degree in Nutrition
							and Health at Wageningen University.
							During my statistics courses, I was introduced to SPSS and R, but it wasn't until my thesis
							and internship that i began to love crunching numbers.
						</p>
						<p>
							During my thesis and internship I analysed data of patients enrolled in (intervention)
							studies of large hospitals, for which I used various statistical methods and clustering
							methods.
							These analyses required precise work and careful consideration of multiple aspects that
							could have
							influenced the results. I loved doing this work and decided to further develop myself into a
							data analyst after my studies.
						</p>
						<p>
							Currently I am employed by Working Talent, a company that offers IT traineeships to young
							professionals who want to change careers or need a career boost. Under their tutelage, I
							have developed into a data analyst capable of working with a variety of tools. A job at a
							top-100 company in The Netherlands will help me develop my skills and gain
							work experience.
						</p>

							<h3>In my personal life</h3>
						</header>
						<p>
							I love being creative, so I spend a lot of my time crocheting and drawing. I am quickly
							enthoustiastic about new projects or learning new skills, I love learning new things!
							I also enjoy spending my time playing games with friends. I particularly enjoy games that
							require a lot of teamwork and/or strategy.
