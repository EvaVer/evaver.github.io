								<h2>Google PlayStore Advice</h2>
								<p>A python project giving advice to a young start-up wanting to create a new app</p>
							</header>
							<p>This project is still under development!</p>
							<p>In a notebook, two datasets containing data from the Google Play Store were
								inspected, cleaned, and analysed. Data analysis was performed on the most relevant data
								in order to give a substantiated advice regarding the creation and launching of one or
								more new apps on the Google Play Store.</p>

							<section>
								<header>
									<h3>Description of the datasets.</h3>
								</header>
								<p>The first dataset is 1,4 MB large, and contains data on all apps on the Google
									AppStore by [date]. It holds data on the app size, the number of downloads, app
									price, app category, and more.
								</p>
								<p>The second dataset was less important. This dataset was 7,7 MB large, and contains
									data on the reviews of the apps in the google AppStore. Every line is a seperate
									review, containing a rating, the translated review, and sentiment polarity (whether
									the review used positive or negative words)and sentiment subjectivity (strength of
									the review).

									<h3>Data Preparation</h3>
								</header>

								<p>
									<bold>Data preparation steps</bold>
								</p>
								<ul>
									<li>inspect the dataset visually</li>
									<li>inspect the datatypes of the variables and change where necessary.</li>
									<li>look for duplicates in the data</li>
									<li>look for missing data: how much information is missing, and is this a problem?
									</li>
								</ul>

								<h4>Move row .....</h4>
								<p>
									During my initial analysis and data preparation , I was unable to turn the new
									variable of "Installs" into an int because the column contained the value 'Free'.
									This value belongs to the category on the right of "Installs", which is "Type". I
									ran into a similar problem when changing the data type of "Price" into a float (also
									code below). It became clear that one or more rows had shifted in the dataset.
								</p>
								<p>Before continuing data preparation, this shifted row needs to be corrected.</p>
								<p>SHOW CODE ON HOW THIS WAS DONE</p>
								<pre>
								<code>
									app_data["Installs"].unique()
								</code>
							</pre>


								<h4>Change datatypes of data</h4>
								<h5>Column 'Reviews' to integer datatype</h5>
								<p>Text here.</p>
								<p>SHOW CODE ON HOW THIS WAS DONE</p>

								<h5>Column 'Installs' to integer datatype</h5>
								<p>Before changing this data to an integer datatype, the '+' and ',' in the string
									values must be removed.</p>
								<p>SHOW CODE ON HOW THIS WAS DONE</p>

								<h5>Column 'Size' to integer datatype</h5>
								<p>The column size contains both numeric and letter values. An example of a value is
									'19M'. In order to change this data type to an integer, the M and K's need to be
									removed from the string, and the numeric values multiplied by either 1000 (K) or
									1,000,000 (M).</p>
								<p>SHOW CODE ON HOW THIS WAS DONE</p>

								<h5>Column 'Content Rating' to category datatype</h5>
								<p>I checked the number of unique values in the 'Content Rating' column and decided this
									column was suitable for a category datatype. A category datatype can reduce memory
									usage by making the categories easier accessible in memory.</p>
								<p>SHOW CODE ON HOW THIS WAS DONE</p>

								<h5>Column 'Price' to float datatype</h5>
								<p>'Price' is a suitable column to turn into a float. Before processing, the data values
									were formatted like '$4.99'. The dollar sign was removed in order to turn this value
									into a float.</p>
								<p>SHOW CODE ON HOW THIS WAS DONE</p>

								<h5>Column 'Type' to category datatype</h5>
								<p>Similarly to the 'Content Rating' column, I checked the number of unique values in
									the 'Type' column and decided this column was suitable for a category datatype.</p>
								<p>SHOW CODE ON HOW THIS WAS DONE</p>

								<h5>Column 'Rating' to float datatype</h5>
								<p>Rating was a float datatype formatted like a string. No special editing was needed to
									change the datatype of this column.</p>
								<p>SHOW CODE ON HOW THIS WAS DONE</p>

								<h4>Duplicate values</h4>
								<p>It is important to check that all app names are unique, otherwise you run the risk of
									analysing the same app multiple times, which will introduce bias.</p>
								<p>Analysis showed a significant number of duplicate rows with the same app name. Rows
									that were completely identical were removed from the dataset. Some rows had the same
									app name but had slight differences in app size, rating, and number of
									downloads. It was decided to keep one row per app and app category, since app
									category is one of the main elements of the later data analysis</p>
								<p>In the end, 1096 rows with duplicate values were removed from the dataset. The
									dataset was left with 9745 rows.</p>

									<h3>Final Advice</h3>
								</header>
								<p>The current Google Play Store app market is filled with a wide choice variety and
									almost 10.000 apps. The app store data of previous years was analysed with a focus
									on the most succesful app categories and target audience, and paid and free apps
									were compared. This data is most valuable to create a business plan for a new app
									startup company</p>
								<p>
									Apps from the app categories communication, video players, social, entertainment,
									and photography are downloaded most often (figure 1). This implies that these
									categories are popular among smartphone users. Other popular categories include
									productivity, game, travel and local, tools, and news and magazines. The app
									categories family, game, and tools hold significantly more apps than other
									categories. Similarly, while the app categories communication and social are large,
									most of these apps connect to large established platforms such as Whatsapp,
									Instagram, Google Hangouts, and more. The market for the app categories family,
									games, tools, communication and social may be saturated already, and therefore my
									recommendation is to focus on another popular categories such as entertainment,
									photography, or productivity.
								</p>
								<p>
									Analysis of the content rating showed that the most app installs were in the
									categories everyone, everyone 10+ and the category teen (figure 5). The highest
									number of installs were in the category teen, and therefore it is recommended to
									focus on this target audience. From the 10 categories with most installs, teens
									installed most apps from the categories video players, socials, news and magazines,
									and entertainment.
								</p>
								<p>
									Lastly, as seen in figure 7, the total number of installs is substantially higher
									for free apps. Consumers might be more willing to try a new free app on the Play
									Store. Therefore, it is recommended to create a free app with possible ads or in-app
									purchases, in order to make the product profitable.
								</p>
								<p>
									In conclusion, the Google Play Store is filled with many apps, but there is still
									space for new apps with new functionality. My recommendation is to create a free app
									targeted at teens in one of the popular app categories such as entertainment,
									photography, productivity, tools, or game.
