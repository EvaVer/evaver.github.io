								<h2>Google PlayStore Advice</h2>
								<p>A python project giving advice to a young start-up wanting to create a new app</p>
							</header>
							<p>In a notebook, two datasets containing data from the Google Play Store were
								inspected, cleaned, and analysed. Data analysis was performed on the most relevant data
								in order to give a substantiated advice regarding the creation and launching of one or
								more new apps on the Google Play Store.</p>

							<section id="description_dataset">
								<header>
									<h3>Description of the datasets.</h3>
								</header>
								<p>The first dataset is 1,4 MB large, and contains data on all apps on the Google
									PlayStore by [date]. It holds data on the app size, the number of downloads, app
									price, app category, and more.
								</p>
								<p>The second dataset was 7,7 MB large, and contains app review data. Every line holds a
									single
									review, including the given rating, the translated review, sentiment polarity
									(whether
									the review used positive or negative words), and sentiment subjectivity (strength of
									the review). Sentiment polarity and sentiment subjectivity were obtained using AI
									text interpretation.
								</p>
								<p>Both datasets were given to me by someone else. They seem to be the same as <a
										href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lava18/google-play-store-apps?select=googleplaystore.csv">this
										Kaggle dataset</a>.</p>

									<h3>Data Preparation</h3>

									<h3>Data Analysis Results</h3>
								</header>
								<p>The data analysis identified popular and succesful app categories and a suitable
									target audience range within these categories. Additionally, the popularity of free
									apps was compared to the popularity of paid apps. These variables were deemed to be
									most important for creating an advice.</p>
								<ul>
									<bold>App characteristics that were studied:</bold>
									<li>App category</li>
									<li>App content rating (age group of target audience)</li>
									<li>App costs</li>
									<li>App downloads</li>
									<li>App rating and sentiment</li>

									<h3>Final Advice</h3>
								</header>
								<p>The current Google PlayStore app market is filled with a wide choice variety and
									almost 10.000 apps. The app store data of previous years was analysed with a focus
									on the most succesful app categories and target audience, and paid and free apps
									were compared. This data is most valuable to create a business plan for a new app
									startup company</p>
								<p>
									Apps from the app categories communication, video players, social, entertainment,
									and photography are downloaded most often (figure 1). This implies that these
									categories are popular among smartphone users. Other popular categories include
									productivity, game, travel and local, tools, and news and magazines. The app
									categories family, game, and tools hold significantly more apps than other
									categories. Similarly, while the app categories communication and social are large,
									most of these apps connect to large established platforms such as Whatsapp,
									Instagram, Google Hangouts, and more. The market for the app categories family,
									games, tools, communication and social may be saturated already, and therefore my
									recommendation is to focus on another popular categories such as entertainment,
									photography, or productivity.
								</p>
								<p>
									Analysis of the content rating showed that the most app installs were in the
									categories everyone, everyone 10+ and the category teen (figure 5). The highest
									number of installs were in the category teen, and therefore it is recommended to
									focus on this target audience. From the 10 categories with most installs, teens
									installed most apps from the categories video players, socials, news and magazines,
									and entertainment.
								</p>
								<p>
									Lastly, as seen in figure 7, the total number of installs is substantially higher
									for free apps. Consumers might be more willing to try a new free app on the Play
									Store. Therefore, it is recommended to create a free app with possible ads or in-app
									purchases, in order to make the product profitable.
								</p>
								<p>
									In conclusion, the Google Play Store is filled with many apps, but there is still
									space for new apps with new functionality. My recommendation is to create a free app
									targeted at teens in one of the popular app categories such as entertainment,
									photography, productivity, tools, or game.
